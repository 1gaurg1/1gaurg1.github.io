    "text": "Treasure Hunt in Anonymous Graphs with Quantum Pebbles by Oblivious Agents\nThis research project done during the Summer 2025 session tackles the formidable Treasure Hunt problem within the challenging environment of anonymous graphs using oblivious agents (full paper availible on arxiv here). In this setting, the graph vertices are unlabelled and indistinguishable, and agents, who execute a look-compute-move cycle in every round, forget all information about previous rounds. Traditional guidance mechanisms, such as stationary classical pebbles, are insufficient for such oblivious agents, leading to an impossibility result for deterministic search strategies. Simple randomized walks were also deemed ineffective, highlighting the acute difficulty of the problem.\nTo overcome these constraints, this work introduced a novel solution leveraging quantum computation: the use of quantum pebbles. A quantum pebble is defined as a source that periodically emits qubits, all in the same fixed quantum state. These quantum pebbles are strategically placed by an Oracle at each node along the shortest path (D steps) from the start to the treasure. Crucially, the state of the emitted qubit is designed to encode the port number leading to the next node on that shortest path.\nSince the agent is oblivious and cannot store memory across rounds, it must rely entirely on local observation and measurement to determine the correct direction. The agent extracts this directional information by performing measurements in multiple quantum bases. For a graph with maximum degree \\(\\Delta\\), this involves constructing \\(\\Delta/2\\) orthonormal bases \\(M(j)\\). By exploiting the probabilistic nature of quantum measurement, the agent determines the correct port number by observing which measurement basis produces an outcome with a probability close to one.\nThe resulting randomized strategy demonstrates remarkable efficiency and provides the first use of quantum information as a guidance mechanism for treasure hunt in anonymous graphs with oblivious agents. The strategy enables the oblivious agent to locate the treasure in \\(O(D)\\) steps, achieving optimal time complexity, using \\(D\\) quantum pebbles. To ensure a high probability of success, the agent needs to perform \\(O((\\log D + \\log \\Delta)/(\\log 1/\\delta))\\) measurements per node, where \\(\\delta\\) is an upper bound on the probability of incorrect measurement. This project further contributed the insight that encoding only the next step at each node is significantly more efficient than attempting to encode the entire path into a single qubit.\nThis challenging and highly specialized project, drawing on concepts from graph theory, distributed algorithms, and quantum computation, was executed largely unsupervised. The ability to independently develop the novel theoretical framework, including the construction of necessary measurement bases and the complex theoretical analysis required to bound failure probabilities and calculate measurement requirements, underscores my proficiency in navigating and contributing to advanced research environments.\n\n\nQuantitative Analysis of Urban Infrastructure: Optimal Subway Route Planning\nThis project was a deep dive into urban planning and quantitative analysis, where I spearheaded an undergraduate research initiative focused on proposing a new subway line in Toronto. The initial phase demanded meticulous data handling, as I was responsible for processing and filtering OpenStreetMap data. Based on this raw geographic information, I developed robust methods for creating a graph representation of major intersections in Toronto, thoughtfully selecting nodes based on highway tags and intersection characteristics to accurately map potential transit pathways.\nThe technical core of this work involved complex optimization. I formulated a comprehensive Linear Programming (LP) problem to model optimal subway line placement. This model was sophisticated enough to incorporate geographic constraints using the Manhattan distance formula. Crucially, I researched and planned the incorporation of a “desirability” factor into the LP model to guide route optimization. This factor was designed to weight multiple characteristics of a potential node, such as population density, proximity to existing transit routes, and property values, ensuring that the resulting route maximized public benefit and addressed areas of need.\nExecuting this strategy demonstrated immediate impact: solving the LP problem resulted in a proposed new subway line capable of bringing more than 20,000 people within walking distance of a subway stop, primarily focusing on previously underserved areas.\nThroughout this process, I gained invaluable practical expertise using powerful analytical tools. This included hands-on experience utilizing or learning libraries like numpy and scipy for matrix operations and mastering the Gurobi solver for constructing and solving the complex LP model. Furthermore, I successfully identified and addressed challenges related to importing and working with large geospatial datasets.\nWhile this particular research did not result in a publication due to limited scope and sampling problems with the initial dataset, the project laid a clear foundation for future expansion. Recommended next steps for scaling this research include expanding the dataset to incorporate cities with larger transit networks, enhancing the optimization intelligence by training the desirability factor with some kind of transformer-based system, and implementing a rigorous validation method to prepare the work for publication."
